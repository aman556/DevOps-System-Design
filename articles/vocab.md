# DevOps Vocabulary: Essential Terms

## General Concepts
- **DevOps**: Development + Operations, a culture and practice that unifies software development and IT operations.
- **Agile**: Methodology promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.
- **SDLC**: Software Development Life Cycle.
- **Automation**: Using technology to perform tasks without human intervention.
- **Collaboration**: Developers and ops teams working together.

## Source Control & Versioning
- **Version Control System (VCS)**: Tools for tracking changes in code (e.g., Git).
- **Git**: Popular distributed version control system.
- **Repository (Repo)**: A storage location for code.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of the repository.
- **Merge**: Integrating changes from one branch to another.
- **Commit**: Saving changes to the repository.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Request to merge code into another branch.

## Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically integrating code changes.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**: Automatically delivering or deploying code to production or staging.
- **Pipeline**: Automated process for building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Build**: Compiling source code into executable form.
- **Test Automation**: Running tests automatically.
- **Artifact**: The result of a build process (e.g., binaries, containers).

## Infrastructure
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
- **Provisioning**: Setting up infrastructure resources.
- **Configuration Management**: Automating system configurations (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet).
- **Server**: A machine (physical or virtual) providing services.
- **Container**: Lightweight, portable, isolated computing environments (e.g., Docker).
- **Container Orchestration**: Managing container lifecycles at scale (e.g., Kubernetes).

## Cloud Computing
- **Cloud Provider**: Companies offering cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Public Cloud**: Cloud resources shared among multiple organizations.
- **Private Cloud**: Cloud resources dedicated to a single organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds.
- **SaaS/PaaS/IaaS**: Software/Platform/Infrastructure as a Service.

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Monitoring**: Observing the health and performance of systems.
- **Logging**: Recording events or data from systems and applications.
- **Alerting**: Notifying teams about critical events or failures.
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measures of system performance (e.g., CPU, memory).

## Security & Compliance
- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security into DevOps practices.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely storing sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**: Managing user permissions and identities.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracking changes and access for compliance.

## Networking
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated cloud network environment.
- **Subnet**: Subdivision of a network.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across resources.
- **Firewall**: Security system for network traffic control.

## Deployment & Delivery
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Switching between two identical environments.
- **Canary Release**: Gradually rolling out changes to a subset of users.
- **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous version.
- **Release Management**: Planning and controlling software deployment.

## Tools & Platforms
- **Jenkins**: Popular automation server for CI/CD.
- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI**: CI/CD platforms.
- **Docker**: Container platform.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform.
- **Terraform**: IaC tool for managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Ansible, Chef, Puppet**: Configuration management tools.
- **Prometheus, Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization.
- **Splunk, ELK Stack**: Logging and search platforms.

## Miscellaneous
- **Artifact Repository**: Storage for build artifacts (e.g., JFrog Artifactory).
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure components are replaced, not modified.
- **Self-Healing**: Systems that can recover from failures automatically.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load.
- **High Availability (HA)**: Minimal downtime, resilient systems.
- **SLA (Service-Level Agreement)**: Commitment to service standards.
- **MTTR/MTTF/MTBF**: Mean Time to Repair/Failure/Between Failures.
- **Observability**: Ability to measure internal states via outputs.
- **Feedback Loop**: Process of continuously improving based on feedback.
